⚠️ CRITICAL CODE REVIEW REQUIRED - DO NOT DELAY! ⚠️

Your review MUST include:
1. Security vulnerabilities assessment
2. Performance implications
3. Code correctness and logic flaws
4. Best practices adherence
5. Clear GO/NO-GO recommendation

Time is of the essence. Other work should be deprioritized.
